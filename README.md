# pray (in terminal)

The purpose of the `pray` is to display the ASCII art of the prayer target in the terminal.  
This package currently includes the ability to display a Shinto altar as ASCII art, providing a unique and visually interesting way to bring symbolic representation to the terminal.  
It is inspired by [YutoriSpine/pray](https://github.com/YutoriSpine/pray).
